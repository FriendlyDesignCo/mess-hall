   <p class="medium">Chef Ris Lacoste has been a fixture on the DC culinary scene for almost two decades. For Ris it has always been about the food and the people. In 2009, she opened RIS, an incarnation of her personal style and taste, which embodies her passion for flavor and commitment to excellence.</p>  

   <p class="medium">Beyond the kitchen, Lacoste’s favorite place to be is in the middle of a local famers’ market, hunting down the freshest fruits and vegetables and meeting the men and women who grow these foods. These markets are not only a source of inspiration for her cuisine, but a meeting point to talk about the importance of investment in the local community and dedication to the ideals of local-sustainable farming. Her involvement in Launch Pad is pure Ris–a dedication to giving back to those who have given her so much.</p>

   <p class="medium"> Union Market is helping to transform the NE section of DC by giving the best creative minds and businesses a place to connect, build community and launch new concepts.</p>

   <p class="medium">The historic Market building was renovated in 2012 into a thriving marketplace of more than 40 local artisans and makers, from Salt and Sundry to Rappahannock Oyster Bar, Chefs not only sharpen their knives here – they try out new concepts. The Market has become the culinary epicenter of Washington, DC, located in NE next to Gallaudet and the KIPP schools. Union Market creates communities, launches businesses and believes in supporting local entrepreneurs as an economic driver for the entire city.</p> 

   <p class="medium"><i>"Opening at Union Market was my first venture outside of our food truck and taught me many things about running the business and operations.  We were very fortunate to be a part of the grand opening in the Fall of 2012 and continue to be an anchor tenant.  Union Market has opened up a world of possibilities for our business in terms of visibility, press, and solidifying operations.”</i> Mike Lenard, TaKorean</p>
