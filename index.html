      to identify and launch a promising new 
      culinary concept at Washington DC’s 
      Union Market.</p>

      <p class="medium">The winner will take over a fully built out, quick service space for 6 – 12 monthsin our city’s largest food hub, Union Market. Here their concept will be put to the test. They will also receive a trove of valuable prizes and invaluable opportunities.</p>

      <p class="medium">Mess Hall, a new food incubator concept in the nation’s capital, conceived the first Launch Pad competition in September 2014 with unprecedented results. The Winner of Launch Pad 2014, Mason Dixie Biscuit Company, was accelerated to market, quickly became DC’s darling, opening at Union Market in December 2014, and has now expanded its footprint from DC to Baltimore to Charlotte, NC in just 4 months’ time.</p>

This competition brings together industry veterans and current operators with a range of experience in the DC community, under one roof at Union Market. </p>
